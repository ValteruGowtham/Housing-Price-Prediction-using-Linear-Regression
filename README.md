# 🏡 Housing Price Prediction

This project uses **Linear Regression** to predict housing prices based on features like area, number of bedrooms, and bathrooms. It also visualizes how each feature individually affects the target variable (price).

---

## 📂 Dataset

Dataset used: `Housing.csv`  
(Contains columns like `area`, `bedrooms`, `bathrooms`, and `price`)

---

## 📌 Features Used

- `area`: Total square feet of the house
- `bedrooms`: Number of bedrooms
- `bathrooms`: Number of bathrooms

---

## 🎯 Objective

Predict the **price** of a house based on its features using:
- Simple Linear Regression (for visualization)
- Multiple Linear Regression (for accurate prediction)

---

## 📈 Visualizations

- Scatter plots of each feature vs price
- Regression line showing predicted trend
- Residual plot to evaluate model performance
